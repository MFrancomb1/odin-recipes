        Lasagna is a classic Italian dish made with layers of wide pasta sheets, rich tomato sauce, flavorful meat or vegetables, and creamy cheese, all baked to perfection.

        <li>1 can (14 ounces/400g) crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>2 cans (6 ounces/170g each) tomato paste</li>
        <li>1 can (15 ounces/425g) tomato sauce</li>
        <li>1/2 cup water</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons sugar</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons dried basil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>12 lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>15 ounces (425g) ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>1 large egg, lightly beaten</li>
        <li>3 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>1 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large skillet, brown the ground beef, Italian sausage, chopped onion, and minced garlic over medium heat. Drain excess fat.</li>
        <li>Add the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, tomato sauce, water, sugar, dried basil, dried oregano, salt, and black pepper to the skillet. Stir well and let the sauce simmer for about 30 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>While the sauce simmers, cook the lasagna noodles according to the package instructions until al dente. Drain and set aside.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, combine the ricotta cheese and lightly beaten egg. Mix well.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
        <li>Spread a thin layer of the meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Place a layer of cooked lasagna noodles on top, slightly overlapping them.</li>
        <li>Spread half of the ricotta cheese mixture over the noodles, followed by a layer of meat sauce and a sprinkle of shredded mozzarella cheese.</li>
        <li>Repeat the layers, starting with another layer of noodles and continuing until all the ingredients are used, ending with a layer of meat sauce and a generous sprinkle of shredded mozzarella and grated Parmesan cheeses on top.</li>
        <li>Cover the lasagna with aluminum foil and bake for 25 minutes. Then, remove the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes, or until the cheese is melted, bubbly, and golden brown.</li>
        <li>Remove from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before serving. Cut into slices and serve hot.</li>
    </ol>
